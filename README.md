# ‚úàÔ∏è **Flight Fare Prediction**


This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, source, destination, duration, and other travel-related information. The objective is to help users get a price estimate and make better booking decisions.

# Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyse flight fare data by applying SQL techniques, perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, and then build a predictive model using machine learning to estimate flight ticket prices based on various travel-related features.

# üìå **Project Overview**
**Domain:** Travel & Aviation

**Goal:** Predict the fare of a flight using historical flight data

**Approach:** Started by performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, followed by feature engineering and building machine learning models in Python.

**Tools Used:**

- SQL: For data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Python: For model building and evaluation

- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For preprocessing and visualisation

- Scikit-learn, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor , RandomForestRegressor
