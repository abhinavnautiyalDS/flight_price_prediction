# ‚úàÔ∏è **Flight Fare Prediction**


This project focuses on predicting flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, source, destination, duration, and other travel-related information. The objective is to help users get a price estimate and make better booking decisions.

# Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyse flight fare data by applying SQL techniques, perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, and then build a predictive model using machine learning to estimate flight ticket prices based on various travel-related features.

# üìå **Project Overview**
**Domain:** Travel & Aviation

**Goal:** Predict the fare of a flight using historical flight data

**Approach:** Started by performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, followed by feature engineering and building machine learning models in Python.

**Tools Used:**

- SQL: For data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Python: For model building and evaluation

- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For preprocessing and visualisation

- Scikit-learn, LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor , RandomForestRegressor

# **About data**

1. **Airline** : 	The name of the airline (e.g., IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet). Different airlines have different pricing strategies.
2. **Date_of_Journey** :	The date on which the passenger is scheduled to fly. Can be split into day, month, and year for analysis.
3. **Source** :	The city from which the flight departs (e.g., Delhi, Mumbai).
4. **Destination** :	The city where the flight is landing.
5 **Route** :	The route taken by the flight, sometimes with stops (e.g., DEL ‚Üí BOM ‚Üí BLR). This can give information about layovers.
6. **Dep_Time** :	Departure time of the flight. Can be broken into hour and minute or part of day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening).
7. **Arrival_Time** :	Time at which the flight arrives at the destination. Similar to departure time, can be transformed.
8. **Duration** :	Total duration of the flight from source to destination.
9. **Total_Stops** :	Number of stops (e.g., non-stop, 1 stop, 2 stops). Usually, more stops mean cheaper flights.
10 **Additional_Info** :	Any extra info (e.g., "No info", "In-flight meal not included", etc.). Might affect pricing.
11 **Price** : The target variable. This is what you're trying to predict using the other features.

# **KEY INSIGHTS**

- Friday is the most expensive day to travel, followed by Sunday.

- Midnight is the cheapest time to fly due to low demand.

- Bangalore ‚Üí New Delhi is the costliest route, while Chennai ‚Üí Kolkata is the cheapest.

- Jet Airways Business class offers the highest fare, likely due to luxury services.

- A positive correlation exists between ticket price and duration.

- More stops often lead to higher fares, but not necessarily longer durations.

- May and June see the highest number of bookings, driven by vacation travel.


# **üõ† Tools Used**

- MySQL / PostgreSQL

- SQL Window Functions, CASE, Aggregations, Joins, CTEs

- Data pre-processing & formatting for temporal analysis
